    <h1>Gifting Vehicles Guide</h1>

    <p>Gifting vehicles allows you to add spawned vehicles to your garage and summon them in the future without mods. Follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <!-- Your steps here -->
        <li>Start with a non-DLC 2-car or 10-car garage. Cheap ones near the airport work well. Apartment garages work, but NOT office, auto-shop, agency, bunker etc...</li>
        <li>On your phone, open Legendary Motorworks, click 2-door, Sort by Price, and select any FREE car. The Annis Eleghy RH8 should be free for all players. Select a color, purchase, and save to your garage.</li>
        <li>Repeat step #2 until the garage is completely full of cars. You can re-purchase the same free car over and over quickly without closing your phone, after purchase click back a few steps and then buy again.</li>
        <li>Walk inside the garage, and drive a car out and return it to the garage with the interact menu (m) to reset your personal vehicle.</li>
        <li>Spawn whatever car you want to keep (<code>deluxo</code>). Make sure it is upgraded how you want, paint colors, wheels, plate text etc...</li>
        <li><span class="important">Do NOT be the lobby host when using the <code>gift</code> command (Players > Name > Friendly > Gift).</span> If you (or giftee) get kicked from the car when you do this command, try NOT being the lobby host.</li>
        <li>Park the spawned car in garage and choose to replace one of the free cars.</li>
        <li>The old cars may end up as invisible vehicles outside the garage door. If this happens clear them away with a <code>dune4</code> ramp buggy, or by other methods (<code>deletegun</code>, World Hacking, etc).</li>
        <li>Your new car may need insurance. This can be purchased from any LS Customs, or free from your own AutoShop.</li>
        <li>Most vehicles cannot be sold at all, or only for a minimal value. If selling for profit use a fully upgraded <code>deathbike2</code> to sell for $1mil per. Limit to selling 2 vehicles per day for safety. (Note the <code>deluxo</code> no longer seems to be sellable ðŸ˜¦ )</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <p>Disclaimer: Also, Rockstar has introduced a new "Vehicle Sell Price Adjustment" system. You can sell a vehicle at full price every 18 hours. Second vehicle sells at only 50% value, third at 20%, and fourth and beyond at only 5%.</p>
